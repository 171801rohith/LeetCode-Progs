# LeetCode-Progs

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), a platform for coding interviews and competitive programming practice. Here, I share my approaches and code for a wide range of LeetCode problems, organized for easy access and reference.

## 📚 Repository Structure

- Solutions are organized by problem name or number, and grouped by programming language where applicable.
- Each solution may include comments explaining the approach and thought process.
- The repository will be continuously updated as I solve more problems.

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve problem-solving and coding skills.
- Track progress on LeetCode.
- Share efficient solutions and techniques with the community.
- Serve as a personal reference for future coding interviews.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

This repository may include solutions in:
- Java

## 💡 Usage

You can browse the solutions by navigating through the folders. Each solution has its own file, often with the problem number and a descriptive name.

Feel free to use these solutions for learning and reference, but **please do not copy them directly for submissions without understanding**. Practicing on your own is the best way to learn!

## ✍️ Contribution

This repository is mainly for my personal learning. However, suggestions, improvements, or corrections are welcome through pull requests or issues.

## 📈 Progress

I aim to regularly update this repo with new LeetCode solutions as I work through more problems and explore different algorithms and data structures.
